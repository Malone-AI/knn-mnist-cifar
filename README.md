Experiments are carried out on mnist dataset and cifar10 dataset to analyze the error rate of K-nearest neighbor algorithm. Among them, mnist data set is loaded through scikit-learn library, while cifar10 data set is too large to upload. So if you want to run this repository's jupyter notebook, Mnist.ipynb can run it directly, while Cifar10.ipynb requires you to create a directory called data in your current working directory and then go
https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html to download cifar10 data sets, and extract the data directory
